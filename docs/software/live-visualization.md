# Live Visualization

WILD_console includes real-time panels for checking selected neural channels, auxiliary signals, camera preview, closed-loop state, and device status during setup and recording.

Live visualization is a monitoring surface. Full-resolution neural, IMU, audio, camera, and event data are written locally to the device microSD card and recovered during export. Use the live view to confirm that the device is configured correctly, sensors are connected, and closed-loop state variables behave as expected.

## What Live View Is For

Use live visualization to check:

- BLE connection state and TX/RX counters.
- Selected neural preview channels.
- Signal scale, saturation, obvious disconnects, and large motion artifacts.
- IMU and auxiliary-channel activity.
- Camera framing and gross focus during setup.
- DSP state, threshold crossings, stimulation state, and TinyML state messages when enabled.
- Recording state before handling the animal.

## Display Controls

- Select neural preview channels.
- Select auxiliary signals from IMU and DSP outputs.
- Adjust display length.
- Adjust display gain.
- Show threshold overlays when closed-loop channels are selected.
- Monitor internal state, stimulation triggers, DSP state, and TinyML state messages.

## Neural Preview

The neural preview is intended for fast quality checks, not for replacing exported electrophysiology data. Use it to confirm that the expected channels are active, that the signal is not saturated, and that preview gain and time scale are appropriate for the bench condition.

For recording sessions, treat exported `amplifier.dat`, event files, and metadata as the analysis source of truth. The live preview may be bandwidth-limited or channel-limited depending on configured mode and wireless conditions.

## Auxiliary and Closed-Loop Monitoring

Auxiliary previews help confirm IMU activity, digital input edges, stimulation markers, and onboard DSP or TinyML states. During closed-loop tests, use the live display to verify that thresholds and state variables change in the expected direction before relying on the configuration in an animal session.

For timing-sensitive triggers, combine live monitoring with exported files and the synchronization procedures documented in [Data Format](data-format.md). Live display timing is useful for operator feedback, but exported event timestamps and correction records are used for analysis.

## Camera Preview

Camera preview is useful for checking field of view, lighting, gross focus, and cable stability before a session. Camera characterization, working distance, and sensor hardware are documented in [Onboard Sensors](../hardware/onboard-sensors.md#camera).

## Power and Bandwidth

Live preview consumes device power and BLE bandwidth. Disable preview when the experiment prioritizes maximum runtime over live monitoring, and recover the full dataset from microSD after the session.

## Status Checks

- Confirm connection and TX/RX counters after BLE discovery.
- Confirm synchronization before starting a recording.
- Confirm recording state before handling the animal.
- Confirm export completion after removing the microSD card.
- Treat SD, BLE, low-battery, and release-image mismatch messages as session blockers until resolved.
