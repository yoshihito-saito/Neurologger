  </a>
</div>

## Before You Begin

- Windows 10 or later for WILD_console.
- Bluetooth 4.0 or later for BLE control.
- A tested microSD card installed in the WILD device. Use Samsung EVO series or tested Lexar cards for first recordings; some SanDisk cards may be unreliable in specific WILD operating modes.
- A battery that can boot the WILD device and sustain the planned recording mode.
- The correct release image for the hardware revision and experiment mode.

## Repository Assets

| Asset | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Prebuilt device images | [Latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/releases/latest) |
| WILD_console installers | [Latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/releases/latest) |
| PCB fabrication files | [PCB](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/tree/main/PCB) |
| 3D-print files | [3Dprint](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/tree/main/3Dprint) |
| MATLAB and Python analysis scripts | [Code](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/tree/main/Code) |

!!! tip "Recommended first path"
    Start with Hardware Setup, then Data Acquisition, then Data Analysis. The SD card, battery, release image, and boot state provide the baseline for troubleshooting.

## First Successful Dry Run

**Goal:** complete a short bench recording and confirm that the public export and analysis path works before changing advanced settings.

**Minimum output folder:**

- `amplifier.dat`
- `analogin.dat`
- `time.dat`
- `info.rhd`
- `CE_params.bin`

**Optional outputs, depending on mode:**

- `adc.dat` for audio workflows.
- `misc.dat` for camera workflows.
- `device_event.*.evt` files after MATLAB preprocessing.
- `IMU.mat` after IMU processing.

**Success criteria:**

1. The WILD device is discovered and connected in WILD_console.
2. A short recording starts and stops cleanly.
3. SD-card export completes without missing-core-file errors.
4. The exported folder contains the expected files for the recording mode.
5. MATLAB or Python post-processing runs without manual file repair.

# Hardware Setup

This checklist covers the physical preparation required before connecting WILD to software.

## Device and Connectors

Connector images identify the stimulation, auxiliary, sensor, sync, and battery interfaces before board power-up.

![WILD connector overview](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_8_connectors.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

The connector-orientation schematic below highlights the power, ground, and USB data-line positions used during the first hardware check. Confirm the actual connector orientation on the assembled WILD device before applying power.

![WILD connector orientation schematic](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_6_Connectors.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

The WILD device uses these connectors to support local acquisition, storage, wireless control, synchronization, and optional stimulation in a compact head-mounted unit. Before powering the device, confirm which interfaces are required for the planned session.

## Preparation Checklist

1. Inspect the PCB and connectors for visible damage.
2. Confirm battery polarity on the JST-SH connector.
3. Insert a tested microSD card.
4. Confirm the recording probe or flexible-probe connection.
5. Confirm the stimulation output, IMU, microphone, camera, and external-sync connections needed for the experiment.
6. Confirm that the device is running the expected released device image.

## microSD Card

Format the card from WILD_console before recording. The microSD card affects both reliability and power draw.

![microSD power comparison](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_10_SDcard_power.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

Battery and SD-card guidance are part of the experimental protocol, not optional accessory setup.

![Battery examples](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_9_batteries.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Released Device Image

Public setup documentation is based on prebuilt WILD release images. Each release image is matched to a hardware revision and experimental configuration. Keep the release tag and image filename in dataset metadata.

Release images are distributed through the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/releases/latest). Follow the release notes for the specific image used in the experiment.

Treat the released device image as part of the hardware setup record. The WILD device, WILD_console version, SD card, battery, and analysis scripts should all be traceable to the dataset.


---

# Source file: docs/getting-started/data-acquisition.md

# Data Acquisition

WILD_console is the main operator interface for BLE connection, synchronization support, recording configuration, selected live preview, closed-loop control, and SD-card export.

WILD is a local-storage neurologger. High-bandwidth neural and multimodal data are written to the device microSD card. BLE supports setup, timing calibration, status messages, command delivery, and selected preview signals.

The current public workflow uses WILD_console on Windows. An iOS-based WILD controller app is in development for device discovery, connection, synchronization support, status checks, and low-bandwidth control. Full-resolution recordings are still recovered from the microSD card.

The WILD device does not need continuous full-bandwidth wireless streaming to preserve the recording. Keep BLE connected when the session needs online preview, parameter changes, or live commands. Otherwise, use BLE for setup and timing coordination, then recover the full dataset from the microSD card.

!!! tip "First-session scope"
    For the first dry run, use only the minimum path needed to connect, record, stop, and export. Leave closed-loop, camera, stimulation, GPIO, and advanced parameter panels unchanged until the basic local-storage workflow is confirmed.

## First-Pass Button Path

For a basic dry run, only a small part of WILD_console is needed. The closed-loop, camera, stimulation, GPIO, and advanced parameter panels can stay unchanged until the device connects, synchronizes, records, and exports reliably.

The online and live figures below are runtime screenshots from WILD_console during hardware sessions. Some window-title or device-list strings may still show older internal labels; the public documentation uses the WILD name consistently.

</p>

![WILD_console runtime screenshot during connected acquisition](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_4_onlineAPI.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Connect

1. Launch `WILD_console.exe`.
2. Click <span class="wild-button-label">Rescan</span> if the device is not listed.
3. Select the WILD device from <span class="wild-button-label">Device List</span>.
4. Click <span class="wild-button-label primary">Connect</span> and wait for device-state and synchronization updates.
5. Confirm that the TX/RX indicators update. If BLE connects but synchronization does not start, check the microSD card and timing setup first.

**Expected signs of success**

- The device appears in the list after rescan.
- The selected row updates device information.
- Connect succeeds without repeated disconnect loops.
- Status labels move past discovery into an active connected state.

## Record

1. Confirm the expected sampling speed and channel count.
2. Leave closed-loop and camera settings unchanged unless the experiment needs them.
3. Use `Wait for start` only when coordinating multiple WILD_console instances.
4. Click <span class="wild-button-label primary">Recording Start</span> to begin local logging on the device.
5. Click <span class="wild-button-label">Recording Stop</span> when the experiment is complete.

**Expected signs of success**

- Recording starts without a parameter or storage error.
- Session duration advances normally.
- The device remains stable through stop.
- Exported files are longer than a trivial test header and have plausible file sizes.

## Field Validation

Before a field or multi-animal session, run a short dry run with every WILD device that will be used.

1. Connect each device and confirm it reaches the synchronized state.
2. Start and stop a short local recording on each device.
3. Export the SD card immediately and confirm expected duration, file size, and representative channels.
4. Use the release image specified for the experiment and hardware revision.
5. For multi-device sessions, repeat the dry run with the planned start order, external I/O wiring, and any camera or TTL sync source attached.

A connected or synchronized GUI state is not proof that data were written for the full intended duration. Treat unexpectedly short files, stalled file-size indicators, unstable offsets, frame drops, or missing channels as blockers before animal recordings.

## Live Display

The real-time view supports selected neural previews, auxiliary signals, IMU and DSP states, stimulation triggers, and threshold overlays. See [Live Visualization](../software/live-visualization.md) for the runtime preview screenshot and display controls.

Disable preview to save power and BLE bandwidth when live monitoring is not needed. Recover full-resolution recording data from the microSD card after the session.

## Download

Insert the SD card and click <span class="wild-button-label primary">Save to Disk</span>. WILD_console exports recordings into timestamped folders with neural, auxiliary, ADC, camera, metadata, and parameter files.

**Expected signs of success**

- Export finishes without stopping at the first folder.
- Core files appear in the export folder: `amplifier.dat`, `analogin.dat`, `CE_params.bin`.
- `time.dat` and `info.rhd` are generated by the documented preprocessing path.
- Optional `adc.dat` and `misc.dat` appear only when audio or camera were enabled.

<p class="wild-operator-note">
  Normal export does not require the red maintenance buttons. <span class="wild-button-label warning">Quick Format</span> is only for preparing a known empty card, and release-image maintenance is outside the routine recording path.
</p>

![WILD_console runtime screenshot of the offline export workflow](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_5_offlineAPI.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Common Blockers

| Symptom | First check |
| --- | --- |
| Device not listed after rescan | Battery, power, BLE discoverability, and whether the expected release image is installed. |
| BLE connects but synchronization never settles | microSD presence, timing wiring, and whether the session is waiting on external sync conditions. |
| Recording starts but export is unexpectedly short | Stop sequence, SD-card write stability, battery stability, and whether the device remained powered through the run. |
| Export folder is missing expected files | Recording mode, whether audio or camera were enabled, and whether preprocessing was run after export. |
| Preview is unstable | Treat preview as optional; confirm local recording first, then revisit BLE preview bandwidth or adapter quality. |

# Data Analysis

The repository includes MATLAB and Python scripts for converting WILD recordings into analysis-ready files.

## Standard Post-processing

1. Export data from WILD_console.
2. Run `WILD_PreProcess.m` to generate corrected headers and timing files.

## Compatibility Record

Document the following for each supported WILD hardware build or dataset:

| Record | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| PCB or device revision | Distinguishes connector layout, sensor options, and supported release images. |
| Release tag and image filename | Ties behavior to a reproducible device image. |
| WILD_console version | Defines the export and control tool behavior used in the session. |
| SD-card model | Affects boot reliability and long-session write stability. |
| Battery model | Affects boot margin, runtime, and peak-load behavior. |
| Enabled modalities | States whether the session used ephys, IMU, audio, video, stimulation, or external sync. |

## Bring-Up Checklist

Before the first recording on a newly assembled WILD device:

1. Confirm that the intended release image and hardware revision match.
2. Confirm battery polarity and boot stability.
3. Confirm microSD insertion and basic discoverability.
4. Confirm BLE connection and synchronization state.
5. Run a short recording, export it, and verify the expected files before any animal session.

## Visual Asset Policy

Public hardware visuals should be traceable to real WILD material: device photographs, CAD or EDA exports, microscope images, measured drawings, software screenshots, or hand-authored diagrams derived from measured hardware. AI-generated device photographs or device-like renders are excluded from WILD hardware documentation.

# Device Overview

The WILD device is a Wireless, Interactive, Lightweight Datalogger: an ultra-lightweight multimodal neurologger for freely behaving animals. It combines local neural data logging, auxiliary sensing, onboard processing, BLE configuration and status, synchronization support, and responsive stimulation.

WILD is not a BLE telemetry system. High-bandwidth neural data are recorded locally to microSD; wireless links are used for discovery, configuration, synchronization support, status, low-bandwidth preview, and online control commands.

The device is best understood as a head-mounted acquisition and control unit. Neural acquisition, auxiliary sensing, embedded processing, microSD storage, external I/O, and optional stimulation are handled on the device. The host computer or controller supports setup, timing coordination, status review, selected preview, command delivery, and export.

# Source file: docs/hardware/onboard-sensors.md

# Onboard Sensors

WILD sensor documentation describes the auxiliary channels recorded alongside neural data or used during bench validation. Treat each enabled sensor as part of the experiment configuration: record the release image, sampling mode, connected module, and whether the output was used for monitoring, downstream analysis, or both.

## IMU

The WILD device includes a 9-axis motion-sensor path for acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetic-field measurements. IMU data support motion-state review, behavioral segmentation, artifact inspection, and alignment with external tracking systems.

For reproducible datasets, document:

- IMU enable state.
- Configured sample rate.
- Axis orientation relative to the mounted device.
- Whether IMU channels were exported in `analogin.dat` or processed into `IMU.mat`.
- Any filtering, resampling, or coordinate transform applied after export.

## Camera

The head-mounted camera path supports synchronized behavioral context when video is enabled in the release image and hardware configuration. Camera payloads are recovered from local device storage during export; live preview is used for setup and focus checks rather than as the full-quality data source.

Record the camera hardware, release image, frame rate, working distance, illumination condition, and decode script version with each dataset.

### Camera Imaging Profile

![Camera imaging profile at 4 mm, 8 mm, and 12 mm working distances](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_11_cameraProfile.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

Use the camera imaging profile during bench setup to choose the working distance and focus range before mounting the camera module. Confirm the expected target distance with live preview before treating camera data as part of the experiment record.

## Microphone

The WILD microphone path uses the SPH6611LR5H ultrasonic microphone for vocalization and high-frequency acoustic recordings. In the documented WILD workflow, microphone data are sampled at 160 kHz, supporting acoustic content up to approximately 80 kHz when the analog path, sampling mode, and export settings are configured for USV recording.

The microphone ribbon assembly includes an embedded 10x amplifier stage before the logger input. Record whether the microphone ribbon and amplifier stage are present, the microphone orientation, and the release image used for acquisition.

For microphone sessions, document:

- Microphone model: SPH6611LR5H.
- Sampling rate: 160 kHz in the USV recording workflow.
- Approximate frequency response target: up to 80 kHz.
- Ribbon/amplifier configuration, including the embedded 10x amplifier stage.
- Audio export file path, decode script version, and any filtering or gain applied after export.

## Digital Inputs

Digital input channels are used for synchronization pulses, behavioral event markers, camera triggers, stimulation markers, or bench validation signals. These inputs are most useful when the same physical pulse is also recorded by the external system being aligned.

For timing-sensitive work, keep the raw digital input record and any generated event files. Post-export correction should preserve both raw event times and the corrected WILD-time event table.

# Source file: docs/hardware/opto-module.md

# Opto Module

The WILD opto-module is the optional stimulation hardware path for optical manipulation experiments. It should be documented separately from the logger board because supported stimulation behavior depends on the opto-module hardware, release image, wiring, and validation procedure.

## Hardware Assets

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Purpose | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual stimulation test | Confirm optical output and wiring before closed-loop use. | Use a bench photodiode, optical power meter, or other approved output check. |
| Closed-loop stimulation output | Deliver stimulation in response to WILD DSP, threshold, or TinyML state when supported by the release image. | Compare event files, stimulation markers, and observed output timing. |
| External trigger stimulation | Drive stimulation from external timing equipment when the experiment requires external coordination. | Record the external trigger and WILD event path for later alignment. |
| Parameter review | Confirm pulse width, intensity, channel selection, and enable state before the animal session. | Save release image, WILD_console version, and stimulation settings with the dataset. |

## Bring-Up Checks

Before connecting the opto-module to an animal-mounted device:

1. Confirm the opto-module PCB revision and compatible release image.
2. Inspect connector orientation and solder joints.
3. Confirm current limit, load, and optical output path on the bench.
4. Run a manual test pulse and record the measured output.
5. Confirm that stimulation markers are exported with the recording when stimulation timing is part of the analysis.

## Metadata

Record the opto-module PCB revision, release image, stimulation channel, optical output calibration, cable or connector path, and validation file. For closed-loop studies, also record the DSP or model state that generated each stimulation event.

# Source file: docs/hardware/usb-board.md

# USB Board

The WILD USB-GPIO board is used for bench validation, external trigger logging, and timing integration with behavioral equipment. It provides a PC-connected GPIO path that can be used alongside WILD BLE control and logger-side digital inputs.

![USB-GPIO board with IO0 to IO3 and USB interface labels](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github-12_GPIOBoard.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Interface

The board exposes four external I/O channels, labeled `IO0` to `IO3`, and a USB connection to the host PC. The USB path is useful for recording external events at the PC, generating TTL outputs for external equipment, and validating synchronization behavior before animal recordings.

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Direction | Use case | Timing note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TTL input logging | External equipment -> USB-GPIO -> PC | Log camera, behavior, or stimulation trigger edges at the host PC. | Host timestamps must be aligned to WILD logger time before merging with neural data. |
| TTL output control | WILD or PC command -> PC -> USB-GPIO -> external equipment | Drive external cameras, stimulation controllers, or behavior systems. | Output timing includes BLE, PC scheduling, USB transfer, and GPIO latency when WILD initiates the command. |
| Periodic sync pulses | Shared pulse to USB-GPIO and WILD digital input | Estimate offset and drift between PC timestamps and WILD logger time. | Use repeated pulses across the recording, not only a start pulse. |
| Bench validation | PC plus WILD test setup | Check wiring, edge polarity, event capture, and software logging before animal sessions. | Keep a short validation recording with raw USB log and WILD export. |

See [GPIO-through-USB Trigger Alignment](../software/data-format.md#gpio-through-usb-trigger-alignment) for timestamp correction, drift monitoring, and the difference between incoming and outgoing trigger paths.

## Recommended Use

1. Assign channel names before the session, for example `camera_trigger`, `behavior_event`, `sync_pulse`, or `stim_marker`.
2. Confirm input or output direction for each channel.
3. Run a short bench pulse train through the same path used by the experiment.
4. Save the USB-GPIO log together with the WILD export.
5. Apply post-export correction before combining PC-side trigger times with WILD neural, IMU, audio, camera, or stimulation events.

## Metadata

Record the USB-GPIO board revision, connected channels, edge polarity, host software, WILD_console version, BLE controller path, and whether the board was used for input logging, output control, or both.

## Design Considerations

- Keep cable strain relief and connector access visible in photos.
- Document orientation of the baseplate relative to probes, stimulation leads, and camera modules.
- Include printing material, layer height, support recommendations, and post-processing steps.
- Add animal-specific mounting notes only after local approval and protocol review.

# Source file: docs/hardware/power.md

# Power

Power planning is central to WILD experiments because battery selection, microSD choice, recording mode, selected preview signals, stimulation, and camera use all affect runtime.

## Power Architecture

The WILD device conditions the selected battery through a converter and regulator chain before powering analog acquisition, digital control, and peripheral subsystems. Battery choice should therefore follow validated hardware-revision guidance rather than a single nominal-voltage number.

Boot, microSD writes, camera use, stimulation, and live preview can create different peak-load conditions. Validate the complete experiment mode on the bench before using a battery in an animal session.

## Battery

The WILD device should use a battery approved for the specific hardware revision and experiment mode. Before mounting the device, confirm that the battery can boot the device without voltage sag, start recording, and sustain the planned sensors, preview state, stimulation, or camera load.

![Battery examples](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_9_batteries.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

The [battery selection table](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/docs/LipoBattery_selection.csv) provides baseline capacity and runtime-planning references.

## Battery Connector

The WILD device battery input uses the JST-SH connector orientation documented in the hardware setup workflow. The connector is part of the experiment record because polarity, strain relief, and repeated mating can affect boot stability and long-session reliability.

![WILD connector orientation schematic](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_6_Connectors.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

For each hardware revision, record:

- Battery connector type and orientation.
- Battery lead polarity as assembled.
- Whether the battery lead was modified, extended, or re-terminated.
- Any strain-relief method used between the battery, enclosure, and animal-mounted device.

Before a recording session, inspect the connector shell, solder joints, and battery lead for looseness or damage. Do not infer polarity from wire color alone; confirm the assembled connector orientation against the WILD hardware revision being used.

See [Hardware Setup](../getting-started/hardware-setup.md) for the first-device connector checklist.

## Battery Charger

The charger is external to the WILD recording path. Charge batteries with a single-cell lithium-polymer charger that matches the battery chemistry, capacity, connector, and manufacturer charge-current rating. Record the charger model when reporting runtime or power stability results.

The WILD device should not be treated as a battery charger unless a specific hardware revision and release note explicitly documents charging support. For the public workflow, charge and inspect the battery before connecting it to the WILD device.

Recommended charger record:

| Item | Record |
| --- | --- |
| Charger model | Identifies the charge circuit used before the session. |
| Battery model and capacity | Links runtime to the actual energy source. |
| Charge current | Helps interpret battery heating, aging, and boot margin. |
| Connector adapter | Documents any JST-SH adapter or lead conversion used between the charger and battery. |
| Pre-session check | Confirms battery voltage, connector condition, and absence of swelling or cable damage. |

## microSD Power

The microSD card is part of the power and reliability budget. Format cards with WILD_console before recording, and validate the selected card in the same sampling and modality mode planned for the experiment.

![microSD power comparison](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_10_SDcard_power.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Runtime Reporting

Runtime depends on sampling rate, active modalities, preview state, stimulation use, microSD-card model, battery capacity, and ambient conditions. When reporting a WILD recording mode, include:

- Release image.
- SD-card model and format state.
- Battery model and capacity.
- Sampling rate and enabled modalities.
- Preview state.
- Stimulation or TinyML state, if used.
- Session environment, especially for outdoor or long-duration recordings.

## Install

Download WILD_console from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/releases/latest). The link always opens the newest published WILD release.

## Public Workflow Boundary

The current public software path is:

1. Connect and record with WILD_console.
2. Export from the device microSD card.
3. Run documented MATLAB or Python post-processing.

The public documentation does not treat BLE as a continuous high-bandwidth acquisition path, and it does not promise a stable general-purpose SDK yet.

## Wireless Control

WILD_console remains the stable public control and export workflow. The iOS-based controller app is being developed as a lighter wireless-control path for BLE discovery, connection, synchronization support, status checks, and low-bandwidth commands.

Full-resolution WILD recordings remain local to the device microSD card and are exported after the session.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later.
- .NET Framework 4.8 for the current GUI.
- Bluetooth 4.0 or later.
- Administrator privileges for some SD-formatting workflows.

## Optional Runtime Files

- `dll_upfirdn.dll` for resampling.
- WILD BLE backend DLL for BLE support in older installer layouts.
- `ffmpeg.exe` for some camera processing workflows.

# Source file: docs/software/acquisition.md

# Acquisition

The acquisition workflow starts by connecting to a WILD device in WILD_console and ends with exported recording folders from the device microSD card.

The WILD device records high-bandwidth neural and multimodal data locally. BLE is used for discovery, synchronization support, configuration, status, selected preview, and control commands rather than continuous full-bandwidth data streaming.

WILD_console is the stable public control path today. An iOS-based WILD controller app is in development for BLE discovery, connection, synchronization support, status checks, and low-bandwidth commands. The iOS app is a controller path; full-resolution recordings remain stored on the device microSD card.

## Wireless Connection Model

The WILD device can be connected for discovery, synchronization support, parameter review, selected preview, and command delivery. After setup and timing coordination, local recording does not depend on continuous full-bandwidth wireless streaming because the device writes the full dataset to microSD.

For multi-device sessions, keep continuous BLE connected only for devices that need live preview or online commands. Devices that only need local logging can be configured and synchronized first, then managed with the planned start, stop, external I/O, and export workflow.

## Routine Operation Map

Most first-session work uses four button groups:

| Stage | Main UI area | Primary click |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discover and connect | Online tab, Device List | <span class="wild-button-label">Rescan</span>, select the WILD device, then <span class="wild-button-label primary">Connect</span> |
| Start recording | Online tab, recording controls | <span class="wild-button-label primary">Recording Start</span> |
| Stop recording | Online tab, recording controls | <span class="wild-button-label">Recording Stop</span> |
| Export data | Offline tab, File panel | <span class="wild-button-label primary">Save to Disk</span> |

Closed-loop settings, camera controls, stimulation parameters, GPIO options, and advanced panels are optional experiment-specific controls. Configure them after the basic connect-record-export path is working.

![WILD_console runtime screenshot of the offline export workflow](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_5_offlineAPI.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Typical Session

1. Start WILD_console.
2. Scan for the WILD device.
3. Connect over BLE.
4. Read current parameters and change experiment-specific settings only when needed.
5. Configure sampling, closed-loop, camera, stimulation, and GPIO options as needed.
6. Start local recording.
7. Monitor selected preview and state signals.
8. Stop recording.
9. Export data from the SD card.
10. Check duration, file size, representative channels, and sync markers before treating the session as complete.

## Multi-Device Sessions

Use one validated release set across all WILD devices. Assign the intended master/follower roles before the session, and keep the same wiring and start order used in the dry run.

For camera workflows, test the external TTL or camera sync path during a short continuous run and confirm that frames, event pulses, and recording files stay aligned before using the setup with animals.

After export, compare recording durations, file sizes, and sample counts across devices. A successful merge should show stable offsets across the recording; jumps, drifting offsets, or one logger ending early should be investigated before the data are treated as synchronized.

## Exported Files

The exported folder can include:

- `amplifier.dat`.
- `analogin.dat`.
- `digitalin.dat`.
- `adc.dat`.
- `misc.dat`.
- `supply.dat`.
- `time.dat`.
- `info.rhd`.
- WILD parameter binary.

# Live Visualization

WILD_console includes real-time panels for checking selected neural channels, auxiliary signals, camera preview, closed-loop state, and device status during setup and recording.

Live visualization is a monitoring surface. Full-resolution neural, IMU, audio, camera, and event data are written locally to the device microSD card and recovered during export. Use the live view to confirm that the device is configured correctly, sensors are connected, and closed-loop state variables behave as expected.

![WILD_console runtime screenshot with live preview and camera windows](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_4_onlineAPI.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## What Live View Is For

Use live visualization to check:

- BLE connection state and TX/RX counters.
- Selected neural preview channels.
- Signal scale, saturation, obvious disconnects, and large motion artifacts.
- IMU and auxiliary-channel activity.
- Camera framing and gross focus during setup.
- DSP state, threshold crossings, stimulation state, and TinyML state messages when enabled.
- Recording state before handling the animal.

## Display Controls

- Select neural preview channels.
- Select auxiliary signals from IMU and DSP outputs.
- Adjust display length.
- Adjust display gain.
- Show threshold overlays when closed-loop channels are selected.
- Monitor internal state, stimulation triggers, DSP state, and TinyML state messages.

## Neural Preview

The neural preview is intended for fast quality checks, not for replacing exported electrophysiology data. Use it to confirm that the expected channels are active, that the signal is not saturated, and that preview gain and time scale are appropriate for the bench condition.

For recording sessions, treat exported `amplifier.dat`, event files, and metadata as the analysis source of truth. The live preview may be bandwidth-limited or channel-limited depending on configured mode and wireless conditions.

## Auxiliary and Closed-Loop Monitoring

Auxiliary previews help confirm IMU activity, digital input edges, stimulation markers, and onboard DSP or TinyML states. During closed-loop tests, use the live display to verify that thresholds and state variables change in the expected direction before relying on the configuration in an animal session.

For timing-sensitive triggers, combine live monitoring with exported files and the synchronization procedures documented in [Data Format](data-format.md). Live display timing is useful for operator feedback, but exported event timestamps and correction records are used for analysis.

## Camera Preview

Camera preview is useful for checking field of view, lighting, gross focus, and cable stability before a session. Camera characterization, working distance, and sensor hardware are documented in [Onboard Sensors](../hardware/onboard-sensors.md#camera).

## Power and Bandwidth

Live preview consumes device power and BLE bandwidth. Disable preview when the experiment prioritizes maximum runtime over live monitoring, and recover the full dataset from microSD after the session.

## Status Checks

- Confirm connection and TX/RX counters after BLE discovery.
- Confirm synchronization before starting a recording.
- Confirm recording state before handling the animal.
- Confirm export completion after removing the microSD card.
- Treat SD, BLE, low-battery, and release-image mismatch messages as session blockers until resolved.

# Data Format

Each WILD device recording session exports a folder with neural data, auxiliary signals, metadata, and optional camera or audio files.

## Files

| File | Verified public handling | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `amplifier.dat` | Read by `WILD_PreProcess.m` as channel-interleaved 16-bit neural data. | Sample count is computed as `file_bytes / 2 / Nch`, with `Nch` read from `CE_params.bin`. |
| `analogin.dat` | Used as the auxiliary stream for digital inputs, IMU, and timing-related channels. | Public MATLAB scripts read this stream as 16 channels at 1250 Hz for preprocessing and IMU extraction. |
| `digitalin.dat` | Optional digital-input export artifact. | Not every workflow generates a separate file; public trigger generation currently derives digital events from `analogin.dat`. |
| `adc.dat` | ADC or audio stream used by microphone workflows. | Public Python decode scripts read this file as `uint16` mono audio and generate `.wav` or `.mp3` outputs. |
| `misc.dat` | Raw camera payload stream. | Public Python decode scripts convert this file into reviewable video outputs. |
| `time.dat` | Generated sample-index timeline. | Public MATLAB preprocessing writes `0:(Nsamples-1)` as `int32`. |
| `info.rhd` | Intan-compatible metadata header. | Generated from `CE_params.bin` by `WILD_genIntanHeader.m`. |
| `CE_params.bin` | WILD parameter binary for system and DSP settings. | The public docs refer to this as the WILD parameter binary; MATLAB tools use the filename `CE_params.bin`. |

## Export Decoding

The WILD device records compact local streams on its microSD card. During the current SD-card download workflow, WILD_console decodes the on-device recording into analysis-facing files: neural samples are written to `amplifier.dat`, auxiliary and timing words to `analogin.dat`, ADC or audio streams to `adc.dat`, camera payloads to `misc.dat`, and session parameters to the WILD parameter binary.

The exported folder is therefore the decoded public data interface. Raw device storage blocks are not the expected analysis input; downstream MATLAB and Python tools operate on the downloaded files and generate derived outputs such as `info.rhd`, `time.dat`, event files, media files, IMU outputs, and spike-sorting inputs.

![WILD_console runtime screenshot of the offline export workflow](../images/WIrelessEphys_Github_5_offlineAPI.jpg){ .wild-readable-figure }

## Time Synchronization

The WILD device keeps high-bandwidth recordings local while WILD_console provides PC-device coordination over BLE. At connection and recording setup, the console synchronizes device state with the PC session and records timing context with the exported dataset.

Timing metadata should be interpreted as a layered system: device sample counts provide the primary sample timeline, PC-device timing coordination supports session-level alignment, and external I/O or digital events provide the most direct alignment path for external cameras, behavior systems, stimulation hardware, and multi-device sessions.

`time.dat` stores the sample-index timeline used by Intan-style workflows, while the WILD parameter binary preserves device-side recording time, hardware version, release image identity, sampling configuration, and DSP settings. External sync lines and digital inputs in `analogin.dat` or generated event files should be retained with the export whenever the experiment depends on cross-device or behavior alignment.

PC-device time synchronization is useful for session organization, export metadata, and cross-device coordination. It should not be treated as a substitute for hardware sync or digital event channels when the analysis requires high-precision alignment.

## GPIO-through-USB Trigger Alignment

USB-GPIO and BLE can bridge external equipment and the WILD device, but the bridge has direction-dependent latency. Keep the two cases separate:

- **Incoming external trigger:** `TTL -> USB-GPIO -> PC -> BLE -> WILD`. The PC can timestamp the TTL edge, but the WILD device receives the related BLE command later. The logged WILD event reflects logger-side receive, handling, or sampled digital-input time, not the original PC timestamp unless the delay has been calibrated.
- **Outgoing WILD trigger:** `WILD -> BLE -> PC -> USB-GPIO -> TTL`. The WILD event begins on the logger time base, but the external TTL output appears later after BLE notification, PC scheduling, USB transfer, and GPIO output latency.

These two paths are not interchangeable. The incoming path maps PC-observed trigger time into WILD logger time; the outgoing path maps WILD events into external-equipment time, or is inverted to express external TTL outputs back on the WILD time base. Each direction should be calibrated with pulses that follow the same direction as the real experiment signal.

For high-precision alignment, prefer a hardware TTL split that is recorded directly by WILD and the external system. When a PC/BLE bridge is part of the experiment, treat the USB-GPIO-to-WILD or WILD-to-USB-GPIO delay as a measured timing relationship rather than a constant assumed to be zero. The delay can include GPIO edge detection, USB packet scheduling, operating-system timestamping, BLE connection interval, firmware handling, and the logger sampling edge.

![USB-GPIO trigger timestamp alignment](../images/WILD_usb_gpio_timestamp_alignment.svg){ .wild-readable-figure }

Recommended synchronization workflow:

1. Choose the bridge direction used by the experiment: incoming `TTL -> PC -> BLE -> WILD`, outgoing `WILD -> BLE -> PC -> TTL`, or a direct hardware TTL split.
2. Add periodic calibration pulses that traverse the same path as the experiment trigger.
3. Record PC/USB-GPIO timestamps, `t_usb`, and export the matching WILD event or digital-input timestamps as logger time, `t_wild = sample_index / fs`.
4. Pair the same pulses across both records and reject missed, duplicated, or ambiguous edges.
5. Fit the direction-specific map. For incoming triggers, use `t_wild = a * t_usb + b`. For outgoing triggers, fit the observed external TTL time against the originating WILD event and invert the map when external timestamps must be expressed in WILD time.
6. Store the direction, fit coefficients, sync-pulse residuals, release image, WILD_console version, USB-GPIO interface, BLE controller path, and trigger wiring with the exported dataset.

Periodic drift monitoring should continue across the recording, not only at the start. A short pre-session pulse train estimates initial delay, but repeated pulses during the session reveal PC clock drift, USB scheduling changes, logger clock drift, missed edges, or an interrupted connection. After fitting the USB-to-WILD time map, inspect residuals over time. A stable residual trace supports a single affine correction; jumps or curvature indicate that the session needs segmented correction, dropped-pulse review, or exclusion from high-precision timing analysis.

Post-export timestamp correction should be applied before merging external triggers with neural, IMU, audio, camera, or stimulation events. The corrected external trigger time is the timestamp expressed on the WILD logger time base, not the original USB host time. Keep both the raw USB-GPIO log and the corrected WILD-time trigger table so the alignment can be audited later.

## Verified Script Assumptions

The following public assumptions are visible in the repository scripts and should be treated as the current documented behavior unless a release note states otherwise:

- `WILD_PreProcess.m` reads `amplifier.dat` as 16-bit neural samples and uses `CE_params.bin` to determine channel count and sampling rate.
- `time.dat` is written as a monotonically increasing `int32` sample index.
- `WILD_processIMU.m` reads channels `2:10` from `analogin.dat`, assumes a 1250 Hz source rate, and writes `IMU.mat` after resampling to 100 Hz by default.
- `WILD_PreProcess.m` reads channel `1` of `analogin.dat` as a `uint16` digital bitfield and generates `device_event.*.evt` files from its bit transitions.
- `WILD_VideoDecodewAudio.py` reads `adc.dat` as `uint16` audio, converts it to signed audio outputs, and assumes a 160 kHz audio path.
- `WILD_VideoDecodewAudio.py` reads `misc.dat` in `320 * 500` byte frame blocks and writes 320 x 320, 16 Hz decoded video outputs.

Where a file layout depends on a specific release image or modality, report the exact release tag and mode together with the dataset. Do not assume that every export contains every optional modality file.

## Multi-Device and Behavior Alignment

For multi-logger sessions, keep the raw export folder for each device and store merge or sync-estimation outputs alongside the derived files. Useful validation checks include matched `amplifier.dat` duration and file size, stable estimated sample offsets, continuous external TTL or digital events, and no unexpected gaps in camera frames.

Behavior datasets should state whether video, UWB, IMU, and ephys streams are expressed on corrected timestamps. Camera calibration, coordinate transforms, identity curation, and delay correction are part of the dataset metadata, especially for outdoor multi-animal work.

When a behavior pipeline produces files such as `behavior_all.mat`, document whether fields are aligned to corrected timestamps such as `timestamps_corrected` and which correction was used. Post-hoc delay estimation or time warping can help evaluate a session, but it should not replace acquisition-side sync validation.

## Intan-Compatible Layout

WILD exports are arranged to be familiar to users of Intan-style recording folders while preserving WILD-specific metadata for sensors, DSP, stimulation, and camera workflows.

## Best Practice

Keep three folders per experiment:

1. Raw SD export.
2. Converted analysis copy.
3. Downstream results from spike sorting, behavior alignment, or machine-learning analysis.

# Embedded Inference

The WILD device supports onboard biomarker detection and behavioral classification for responsive stimulation.

Current WILD releases are intentionally conservative: embedded models are curated into validated release images and reviewed for RAM use, compute timing, sampling schedules, storage interactions, and closed-loop behavior.

## Current Model Integration

Current support uses validated, experiment-specific models rather than arbitrary runtime uploads.

- Models are distributed as part of validated release images.
- RAM use is curated before deployment.
- Inference timing is checked against acquisition, storage, BLE, and DSP tasks.
- Model output is integrated with device state reporting and closed-loop logic.
- Release image and model identity are recorded with each experiment.

This approach keeps timing behavior predictable on resource-constrained embedded hardware.

## Generic Model Support

Generic model loading is not part of the stable public workflow yet. Current releases prioritize predictable timing, memory use, and closed-loop behavior.

Closed-loop model releases define:

- Accepted model format and quantization requirements.
- Maximum model size and tensor arena limits.
- Input and output tensor conventions.
- Inference scheduling relative to acquisition and DSP.
- Validation procedure before animal experiments.
- How model version, release image, and experiment metadata are recorded.

!!! warning "Deployment discipline"
    Embedded models are part of the validated device release. A model that passes desktop inference tests may still be unsafe for closed-loop use if RAM pressure or inference timing affects acquisition, storage, or stimulation behavior.

# Programmatic Workflows

WILD_console and the listed scripts form the supported public interface for acquisition, export, post-processing, and validation.

WILD_console handles BLE discovery, synchronization support, configuration, selected preview, and SD-card export. Full-resolution recordings are recovered from local storage rather than streamed continuously over BLE.

An iOS-based WILD controller app is in development for wireless device control. The current stable public export and post-processing workflow remains WILD_console plus the documented MATLAB and Python scripts.

!!! warning "No stable SDK yet"
    The supported public programmable surface is WILD_console plus the documented repository scripts. The project does not currently document a stable general-purpose SDK with a versioned command contract.

## Current Support

| Area | Current operation style | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition | WILD_console | BLE discovery, connection, synchronization support, recording setup, selected live preview, closed-loop configuration, and SD-card export. |
| Wireless control | iOS controller app, in development | BLE discovery, connection, synchronization support, status checks, and low-bandwidth commands. |
| Post-processing | MATLAB scripts | Header generation, timing correction, event export, IMU processing, and Intan-compatible output preparation. |
| Camera/audio decoding | Python scripts | Decode `misc.dat` and related audio data into reviewable media outputs. |
| Batch processing | Python and MATLAB scripts | Process folders of recordings after SD export. |
| GPIO logging | Python utility | Log serial/GPIO event data during validation or synchronization tests. |
| Release and model tracking | Release metadata workflow | Record release image, model identity, and tool version for reproducibility. |

## Supported Scripted Operations

The current public API surface is organized around these operations:

- Export recording folders from WILD_console.
- Generate corrected `info.rhd` and `time.dat` outputs.
- Convert raw WILD camera/audio data into media files.
- Process IMU channels into calibrated signals.
- Batch-process recording folders.
- Log GPIO or serial synchronization events.
- Preserve software, release-image, and model versions in experiment notes.

## Device Operation Categories

WILD_console and controller workflows expose device operations at a task level. Public documentation should describe these operations by purpose rather than by low-level command ID.

| Category | Typical operations |
| --- | --- |
| Recording control | Set recording parameters, start local recording, stop local recording, and confirm recording state. |
| Preview control | Start or stop selected-channel preview and choose preview channels without treating BLE as the full-resolution data path. |
| DSP and TinyML setup | Load curated DSP or model parameters from a validated release image and record the selected configuration in metadata. |
| Stimulation control | Configure stimulation intensity, thresholds, timing, and manual test triggers when the hardware revision supports stimulation. |
| Time and synchronization | Check the connection, coordinate PC-device time, set device time, and retain external I/O events for experiment-level alignment. |
| Device status | Read parameters, battery state, available storage, device identity, and release-image metadata. |
| Power state | Request sleep or reset only as part of the documented maintenance or field-session workflow. |
| External I/O | Route GPIO and synchronization signals to cameras, behavioral systems, stimulation modules, or additional WILD devices. |

## Tool Metadata

For reproducible use, record the following metadata with tool outputs and example datasets:

- Tool name and version.
- Required operating system and dependencies.
- Input folder or file layout.
- Command or launch procedure used.
- Output files and naming convention.
- Expected runtime and memory requirements.
- Failure modes and troubleshooting notes.
- Validation file or representative dataset, when available.

## SDK Status

WILD_console operations and documented processing scripts are the supported public surface. Script internals remain implementation details unless a workflow is explicitly documented.

# Source file: docs/analysis/python.md

# Python

Python utilities cover camera decoding, audio handling, GPIO logging, and validation after SD-card export.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`WILD_VideoDecodewAudio.py`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_VideoDecodewAudio.py) | Decode camera data with audio handling. |
| [`WILD_VideoDecodewAudio_v2.py`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_VideoDecodewAudio_v2.py) | Alternative video decode pipeline. |
| [`WILD_VideoDecodewAudio_folder.py`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_VideoDecodewAudio_folder.py) | Batch folder processing. |
| [`WILD_GPIO_Logger.py`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_GPIO_Logger.py) | GPIO logging utility. |

## Typical Use

- Decode camera or audio files after exporting a recording folder.
- Batch-process multiple recording folders with the folder variants.
- Log GPIO or serial events during synchronization validation.
- Keep generated media and logs separate from the raw SD export.

## Interactive Commands

Run the Python tools from the repository `Code` folder:

```powershell
cd C:\code\github\Neurologger\Code
python .\WILD_VideoDecodewAudio.py
python .\WILD_VideoDecodewAudio_folder.py
python .\WILD_GPIO_Logger.py
```

- `WILD_VideoDecodewAudio.py` opens a file picker for one `misc.dat` recording and expects the matching `adc.dat` file when audio is present.
- `WILD_VideoDecodewAudio_folder.py` opens a folder picker and recursively processes `misc.dat` files below that root.
- `WILD_GPIO_Logger.py` prompts for a COM port and output folder, then writes a timestamped text log.

## Expected Outputs

```text
example_recording/
  misc.dat
  adc.dat
  adc.wav
  adc.mp3
  misc.mp4
  misc_wAudio.mp4
```

Output names depend on the script path and whether audio is present, but the public decoder workflow writes reviewable media next to the source export by default.

# Source file: docs/analysis/matlab.md

# MATLAB

MATLAB scripts currently provide the main preprocessing path for WILD recordings.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`WILD_PreProcess.m`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_PreProcess.m) | Generate corrected headers, timing files, and event outputs. |
| [`WILD_PreProcessFolder.m`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_PreProcessFolder.m) | Process multiple recordings. |
| [`WILD_ReadHeader.m`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_ReadHeader.m) | Read WILD parameter headers. |
| [`WILD_processIMU.m`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_processIMU.m) | Process IMU data. |
| [`WILD_scaleIMU.m`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_scaleIMU.m) | Scale IMU signals. |
| [`WILD_genIntanHeader.m`](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/blob/main/Code/WILD_genIntanHeader.m) | Generate Intan-compatible header output. |

## Minimal Workflow

```matlab
cd("C:\code\github\Neurologger\Code");
recording_path = "C:\WILD\example_recording";
WILD_PreProcess(fullfile(recording_path, "amplifier.dat"));
WILD_processIMU(fullfile(recording_path, "analogin.dat"), 100);
```

Adjust paths and sampling assumptions for your recording mode.

## Expected Folder Layout

**Input**

```text
example_recording/
  amplifier.dat
  analogin.dat
  CE_params.bin
  adc.dat           # optional
  misc.dat          # optional
```

**Outputs generated by the public MATLAB path**

```text
example_recording/
  time.dat
  info.rhd
  IMU.mat
  device_event.d01.evt   # if digital events are present
  device_event.s01.evt   # if stimulation-related event files are generated
```

## Known-Good First Pass

1. Run `WILD_PreProcess` on `amplifier.dat`.
2. Confirm that `time.dat` and `info.rhd` appear.
3. Run `WILD_processIMU` on `analogin.dat`.
4. Confirm that `IMU.mat` is generated.
5. Keep the raw export unchanged and write downstream results into a separate analysis copy when reprocessing.


---

# Source file: docs/analysis/spike-sorting.md

# Spike Sorting

WILD neural data can be organized for downstream spike sorting after export and preprocessing.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Preserve the raw WILD export folder.
2. Run WILD preprocessing to generate `info.rhd`, `time.dat`, and corrected metadata.
3. Confirm sampling rate, channel count, channel ordering, and probe geometry.
4. Prepare a sorter-specific working directory.
5. Run quality-control checks before interpreting units.

## Recommended Sorter

Kilosort is the recommended starting point for spike sorting exported WILD electrophysiology recordings. Keep the sorter working directory separate from the raw SD export and keep channel-map files with the processed dataset.

!!! note
    Do not assume a generic channel map. Document the exact probe and channel ordering used for each dataset.

# Source file: docs/examples/index.md

# Examples

These example workflows summarize common WILD device use cases and the metadata needed to make each experiment reproducible.

## Workflow Index

| Example | Scope | Expected validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic neural recording | Battery, SD format, BLE connect, recording, export, preprocessing. | `amplifier.dat`, `analogin.dat`, `time.dat`, `info.rhd`, `CE_params.bin`. |
| Closed-loop ripple detection | Filter setup, thresholding, stimulation configuration, validation waveform. | Event files, threshold traces, and stimulation timing review. |
| Theta phase stimulation | Hilbert mode setup, phase logic, stimulation timing, event export. | Phase-locked trigger timing and stimulation event checks. |
| Multi-animal synchronization | Multiple WILD_console instances, start timing, sync line, analysis alignment. | Matched durations, stable offsets, and retained sync events. |
| Outdoor recording | Power planning, SD choice, wireless checks, data integrity checks. | Complete export, no unexpected truncation, and logged power configuration. |
| Camera plus IMU | Camera decode, IMU processing, and behavioral alignment. | Reviewable video output and generated `IMU.mat`. |

## Required Metadata

For each public dataset or protocol, record:

- Goal.
- Hardware revision.
- Release image.
- Software version.
- Required accessories.
- Step-by-step protocol.
- Expected outputs.
- Troubleshooting notes.
- Example data or a small validation file.

## Priority for Expanded Protocol Pages

The highest-value example pages to expand next are:

1. Basic neural recording.
2. Multi-animal synchronization.
3. Closed-loop ripple detection.

These three paths cover the first successful dry run, cross-device timing, and one validated responsive-control workflow.

# FAQ

## Is WILD a replacement for wired acquisition?

WILD is designed for wireless and naturalistic experiments where tethered acquisition is limiting. The correct choice depends on channel count, runtime, signal quality, synchronization, and behavioral constraints.

## Is WILD a BLE telemetry system?

No. WILD is primarily a local-storage neurologger. High-bandwidth neural and multimodal data are recorded to the device microSD card. BLE is used for discovery, configuration, synchronization support, status, selected low-bandwidth preview, and control commands.

## Will WILD have an iOS controller?

An iOS-based WILD controller app is in development for device discovery, BLE connection, synchronization support, status checks, and low-bandwidth commands. Full-resolution recordings will still be stored locally on the device microSD card.

## What is the current recording scale?

The current open-source workflow is the 64-channel WILD system. Neuropixels-compatible and active-SPI-probe variants are higher-performance research targets and are separate from the current public release unless a release note explicitly states otherwise.

## How do I install the PC software?

The latest installer is available from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ayalab1/Neurologger/releases/latest), with setup details in the acquisition guide.

## BLE connects, but recording does not start

The microSD card is the first item to verify. SD format and card compatibility are common causes when BLE connects but synchronization does not begin.

## Does WILD support TinyML?

WILD supports online inference of curated, experiment-specific models through validated release images. Runtime generic model loading is not part of the stable public workflow yet.

## How do I cite WILD?

Use the Nature Methods citation listed on the [Publications](publications/index.md) page. Reproducible methods should also include the WILD hardware revision, release image, WILD_console version, and analysis-script version.

## Where do new diagrams go?

Source diagrams are best kept editable where possible, with web-ready images exported into `docs/images/`. For readable architecture diagrams, Mermaid in Markdown is preferred.
